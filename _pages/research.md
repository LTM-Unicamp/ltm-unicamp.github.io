### Multiscale topology optimization of thermoelastic structures considering multiple materials
Lidy Marcela Anaya Jaimes: Thermoelastic structures are structures subjected to thermal and mechanical loads where the properties of the materials, which they are composed, play an important role in its behavior. Due to this, this research focuses on the analysis and the topology optimization of thermoelastic structures considering the macroscale, the microscale and concurrent topology optimization using multiples materials.

### Topology optimization of metamaterials
Lidy Marcela Anaya Jaimes: A metamaterial is an engineering material with properties that are not found in nature. This research focuses on the analysis and topology optimization of metamaterials using inverse homogenization and the BESO method to find the distribution of multiples materials within a cell to obtain a desired property considering a constant thermal load.

### Topology optimization of piezoelectric energy harvesting devices
Breno Vincenzo de Almeida: Topology optimization of piezoelectric energy harvesting devices using finite element discretization and the Bidirectional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) method. This researchâ€™s motivation is the increasing demand for cleaner energy and more efficient electric systems. With the advances on 3D printing technology, more sophisticated structures may be manufactured, thus, increasing the viability of producing efficient topologically optimized energy harvesters. The gif shows the evolution of a beam-like periodic harvester along the optimization process.

### Structural Topology Optimization for High Natural Frequencies and Band Gaps
Heitor Nigro Lopes: This research adresses the optimization of a structure's natural frequencies using the Bidirectional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) method. This includes maximization and minimization of eigenvalues, as well as maximization of the separation of two consecutive ones. In addition to studying and proposing new methods for natural frequency optimization (particularly for high-frequency range), the influence of structural periodicity and the band gap phenomenon are analyzed.
