The Laboratory of Topology Optimization and Multiphysics Analysis (LTM) is a research laboratory at the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.fem.unicamp.br/index.php/pt-br/) of the [University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/) (UNICAMP). 

Our research is based on Structural Topology Optimization and Multiphysics/Multiscale Analysis, including studies on new numerical evolutionary methods and bio-inspired design strategies. Our team is composed of engineers and undergraduate students that investigate the following subjects: static and dynamic structural design methods, multiscale and periodic systems, vibroacoustics, poroelasticity, fluid-structure interactions, load dependent problems, fluid actuated systems, nonlinear materials models, metasurfaces/metamaterials, among others (see [Research](research)).

In order to conduct our studies and investigations we are partially funded by the following organizations: [Coordination of Superior Level Staff Improvement](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br) (CAPES), [National Council for Scientific and Technological Development](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br) (CNPq) and [SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation](https://fapesp.br/) (FAPESP). We are also part of the [Center for Computing in Engineering & Sciences](https://cces.unicamp.br/), being a world-class multidisciplinary research Center dedicated to advanced computational modeling in physical and chemical molecular sciences, computational mechanical engineering and materials, computational biology and bioinformatics, computational geophysics, and computer science.
